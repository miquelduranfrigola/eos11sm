Title:  Ressemblance to a curated list of known antibiotics
Description: A curated list of about 600 known antibiotics from AntibioticDB
  and the Collins lab (MIT) is used as a reference to identify compounds that ressemble
  known antibiotics. The tool can be used, for example, to remove unattractive compounds
  in virtual screening. The ressemblance score is computed using a logistic regression
  taking into account Tanimoto similarity over multiple molecular fingerprints.
