Status: In progress
Title: Similarity to known antibiotics
Description: This model uses a curated list of known antibiotics from AntibioticDB
  as well as a list provided by the Collins lab to identify compounds that ressemble
  known antibiotics. The tool can be used, for example, to remove unattractive compounds
  in virtual screening
